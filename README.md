# Built in Sherbrooke

![](https://circleci.com/gh/allaire/builtinsherbrooke.svg?style=shield&circle-token=:circle-toke)

**A collection of Sherbrooke's best tech companies, startups, agencies, resources, and events.**

Everything for the site is available to be modified here. To submit a company/agency/startup/investor, [fork the repo and submit a pull-request](#how-to-add-a-company) with the changes. Same deal for making any changes to existing entries.

## How to add a company

To add your entry, follow [the steps for forking the repo and creating a pull-request][fork repo] and update the `data/entries.yml` file with your entry's information. The mandatory information to include is:

```
- name: Entry Name
  category: company | agency | resource | event
  url: www.name.com
  description: Some nice description about the entry. Preferrably between 125-175 characters. Like a long tweet.
```

Optionally, you can add:

```
- ...
  ...
  twitter: entryname
  facebook: entryname
```

Save your entry at the bottom of the file (use spaces for the indentation, not tabs — YAML doesn't like tabs). Note a couple of guidelines (also see the existing entries for a better idea of what to write):

1. **category**: Use singular categories (event instead of events). Only list each entry as one, otherwise you might break something.

2. **url**: Don't put in the `https://` or `http://`. Preferably, don't put in the `/en` or `/fr` either (if it's a bilingual site) — just link to the root domain since it will likely be the more popular version.

3. **description**: Ease off the *marketing lingo* and definitely leave off the *investor speak* (ie there better not be any appearences of 'digital solution' or 'synergy' anywhere in your description). Use the [third-person narrative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_person) preferrably (ie. don't say 'Shopify is the best platform for YOU to build an online store').

4. **twitter** (optional): leave off the `@`. Preferrably all lowercase.

5. **facebook** (optional): preferrably all lowercase.

As for the image/logo, fire up Photoshop and [download this template PSD](http://d.pr/f/17fZu). If you turn on the guidelines, make sure your logo fits inside the inner guidelines and is roughly centered. Preferrably, use a background color other than white (it makes your company standout more and looks less boring). Save the image as a JPEG. **Put the logo in the `source/assets/images/entries/` directory**.

**Commit and push. Then open up a pull-request.** If the pull-reqest is approved, it will be merged and automatically pushed to the site via a build process on CircleCI.

**If this all sounds too technical**, feel free to [create an issue][create an issue] with the same information (logo, name, description, etc.) and one of the maintainers will add it in when they get time.
